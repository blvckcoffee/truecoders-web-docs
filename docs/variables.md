title: Variables
---

We use variables to provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.

**Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.**

Naming variables is known as one of the most difficult tasks in computer programming. When you are naming variables, think hard about the names. Try your best to make sure that the name you assign your variable is accurately descriptive and understandable to another reader.

When you assign a variable, you use the = symbol.

The name of the variable goes on the left and the value you want to store in the variable goes on the right.

```
let x = 7
```

The names of variables, called _identifiers_, conform to certain rules:

- A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (\_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).

- Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).

- You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. For more details, see [this blog post](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6).
- You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.

- Some examples of legal names are: Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and \_name.
