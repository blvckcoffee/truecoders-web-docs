This is an example of the blog functionality, where members of the team could share information that they want students to be aware of. Moving toward a documentation solution that puts all of the course material in a single place and allows team members to write markdown files that can be added to the live site via github pages would make changes more seamless than editing and sharing google docs. The future is now!
